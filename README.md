## What it does
SmileVerse comes up with a platform to post memes and gifs that are dedicated to bring a smile on peoples face and entertain them. Anyone using the app can vote some "smiles" to the post. A high number of smiles indicates the popularity of the meme.
The creators will be easily able to turn their popular memes into nfts by uploading it to the SmileVerse NFT marketplace using the application or in the SmileVerse website.
If the memes are mindblowing to the users and feels like rewarding them, then they could gift some SmileVerse tokens(SMILE) which will be used throughout the SmileVerse and will have some real value. These SMILE tokens can be either bought or earned from the SmileVerse.

## How we built it
SmileVerse is built using Next js. The smart contracts are based on Ethereum blockchain. The contracts are tested and deployed using Hardhat Ethereum development environment.
