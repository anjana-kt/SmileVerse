## SmileVerse

## Inspiration
Have you ever heard the quote “laughter is the best medicine?”  Well, it’s true! The presence of humour in a person’s life lightens your burdens, inspires hopes, connects you to others, and keeps you grounded, focused, and alert. Memes are one of the quickest and easiest ways to incorporate humor into one’s daily life. Simply scrolling through an Instagram meme page during a lunch break can take some edge off a stressful day.
Similar to emojis, memes have the capability of sending messages to people without having to use words, and therefore, make them inclined to spread. Besides getting a good laugh and communicating with others, memes provide yet another platform for people to understand a concept, idea or opinion that they may not have heard about, thought of or considered before. The social networks of today are perfect for transmitting these cultural genes. If a post strikes a chord with the audience, it can go global almost instantly. The most successful memes tend to capture a moment, a thought, or feeling in a visual, social media-friendly format.

## Problem
Ever had that feeling when your friends take credit for your jokes and re-use them to other people just seconds after you told them? May be this can be a problem if your jokes are good enough to earn some dollars. 
1. As mentioned above the benefits of memes are tons but it will be difficult for a dedicated meme creator to generate income even though memes are a part of the Entertainment sector.
2. Moreover we lack a good social platform dedicated for memes and for such entertaining communities.
 
## What it does
SmileVerse comes up with a platform to post memes and gifs that are dedicated to bring a smile on peoples face and entertain them. Anyone using the app can vote some "smiles" to the post. A high number of smiles indicates the popularity of the meme.
The creators will be easily able to turn their popular memes into nfts by uploading it to the SmileVerse NFT marketplace using the application or in the SmileVerse website.
If the memes are mindblowing to the users and feels like rewarding them, then they could gift some SmileVerse tokens(SMILE) which will be used throughout the SmileVerse and will have some real value. These SMILE tokens can be either bought or earned from the SmileVerse.

## How we built it
SmileVerse is built using Next js framework as the very base of this Dapp. The smart contracts are based on Ethereum blockchain written in Solidity. The contracts are tested and deployed using Hardhat Ethereum development environment. It was deployed in localhost and later to Polygon Testnet.

## Challenges we ran into
Being a complete beginner on blockchain itself was the biggest challenges that we faced. The biggest problem faced during the learning and coding phase was the initial setup and the bug hunting process. Staying motivated throughout the hackathon period was another big challenge that we faced. Even using the Next js was a challenge for us.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Starting from the 'b' of Blockchain during the begining of this month and now able to deploy the applications in testnet itself is a success.
We were able to completely build and deploy a very basic version of our SmileVerse project in Polygon mumbai testnet.

## What we learned
During this hackathon we could learn so much about solidity and smart contracts. Learned to use Hardhat Ethereum developers environment and deploy application in a real Testnet.
